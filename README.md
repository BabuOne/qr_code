## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties

### What I learned

### Continued development

I haven't made this site responsive for smaller screens. I will need to go back and update as I am trying to work without bootstrap to learn the fundamentals first.

### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_flexbox_responsive.asp) - Will need to go back to fully understand and implement the Flexbox.
- [Example resource 2](https://www.w3schools.com/css/tryit.asp?filename=trycss3_flexbox_perfect_center) - As well as perfect centering which I'm not sure is what is needed
